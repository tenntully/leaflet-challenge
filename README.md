# leaflet-challenge

All work done by Jason Hanlin May 7, 2023.  Used library documentation, Dr. A's live code demos, StackOverflow searches and ChatGPT to troubleshoot issues, refine syntax, and evaluate formatting options. Other sources are referenced in code.  

Start with index.html for main page html code and the mapping folder for the following files:
 - leaflet01.html
 - logic01.js
 - style.css
